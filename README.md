# CI-CD-project-using-AWS-CodeCommit
This project develops a Continous Integration and Continous Delivery Pipeline by using only AWS services like CodeCommit, Elastic Beanstalk and RDS

## Overview

*Continuous integration(CI)* is a DevOps software development practice where developers regularly merge their code changes into a central repository, after which automated builds and tests are run. The key goals of continuous integration are to find and address bugs quicker, improve software quality, and reduce the time it takes to validate and release new software updates.

*Continous Delivery(CD)* is a software development practice where code changes are automatically prepared for a release to production. Continuous delivery expands upon continuous integration by deploying all code changes to a testing environment and/or a production environment after the build stage. When properly implemented, developers will always have a deployment-ready build artifact that has passed through a standardized test process.

This project focuses on implementing a full CI-CD pipeline using AWS services for the vprofile-project.
It serves as an alternative choice of developing and deploying a pipeline without using external tools like Jenkins and Github. Instead we use AWS CodeCommit to store the source code and AWS Codebuild service to build the code and pipeline service to execute the pipeline.

## Services Used
- AWS CodeCommit
- AWS CodeBuild
- Elastic Beanstalk
- Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS)
- Amazon Elasticache
- AmazonMQ
- S3
- EC2

## Project Architecture
![DDC_AWSCiCDProArch](https://github.com/SumitM01/CI-CD-project-using-AWS-CodeCommit/assets/65524561/856bd8c2-9d5d-44fc-a9bc-f377a8b4c51e)

The following things take place when a commit takes place:
- Whenever a commit is made the CodeCommit pipeline is triggered automatically.
- The code is prepared and sent to Codebuild service from the CodeCommit repository.
- The Codebuild service then builds the artifact from the source code and uploads the artifact into a S3 bucket. 
- Elastic Beanstalk (EB) fetches the artifact from the S3 bucket and hosts the application from the bucket.
- The EB  security group is connected with the backend security group to allow visiting traffic to the backend services.
- Backend service group includes services like:
    - AmazonMQ service
    - Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS)
    - Amazon Elasticache 
## Implementation Details

### CREATE A BUILD JOB :
- **CODECOMMIT CODEBUILD**
    - Create project:
         - Select repository and branch as *vp-rem* 
         - Managed image go for ubuntu
         - Create a new service role
         - Select 3gb memory and 2 vCPUs 
         - insert build commands by opening editor and pasting contents of buildspec.yaml file
         - Create s3 bucket and select that bucket for artifact storage
         - Configure cloudwatch logs 
         - Edit the codebuild-vprofile-Build-service-role in IAM and add AmazonS3FullAccess permission to it.
  ![codebuild-setup-success](https://github.com/SumitM01/CI-CD-project-using-AWS-CodeCommit/assets/65524561/67b71f9e-5dd5-4dce-9c7d-708308009c54)

    - Run the build

### CHANGE Elastic Beanstalk CONFIGURATION:
- **CONFIGURATION -> CONFIGURE INSTANCE TRAFFIC AND SCALING**
	- Go to processes and edit the existing process:
        - Under Healthcheck section change path to /login.
        - Under Session section check the stickiness enabled option.
    - Save and apply the changes then wait for the changes to be completed successfully.


### CREATE THE PIPELINE : 
- **CODECOMMIT PIPELINE**
    - Name the pipeline
    - Select source as Codecommit, select your repository and branch
    - Select Codebuild as your build provider and specify your existing project
    - Select Deployer as Elastic beanstalk, select your app, select your env
    - Review and create pipeline.

As soon as the pipeline is created, it is triggered and the execution takes place.

## Results
As artifact is deployed, I validated it by visiting the following pages:
- **Login Page**
![login-page](https://github.com/SumitM01/CI-CD-project-using-AWS-CodeCommit/assets/65524561/7efbbbe6-d450-4780-a54a-9ed6fec2e4be)
- **Home Page**
![home-page](https://github.com/SumitM01/CI-CD-project-using-AWS-CodeCommit/assets/65524561/b3dade74-61d4-4867-9938-46eedf123423)

Here we can see that the backend services RDS, Elasticache and RabbitMQ are also configured correctly.
- **Rabbitmq status**
![rabbitmq-start-success](https://github.com/SumitM01/CI-CD-project-using-AWS-CodeCommit/assets/65524561/c600d583-18e2-4daf-845c-39febf678ab3)
- **User Details Page**
![user-details-page](https://github.com/SumitM01/CI-CD-project-using-AWS-CodeCommit/assets/65524561/0e7aa500-b972-4ff6-ba4a-f687c115f826)
